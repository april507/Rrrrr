## Welcome to my learning on machine learning

This is a place for me to build hypothesis, do experiments, and record my learnings using various datasets. 

*****
### Projects 

* [Customer churn project](https://april507.github.io/Rrrrr/projects/churn/main.nb.html)
* [Bike sharing project](https://april507.github.io/Rrrrr/projects/bike_sharing/main.nb.html)

*****
### General Guideline

* When making decisions, keep in mind trade-offs between speed, explainability, simplicity, performance, and more

*****
### Logistic Regression

* L1, L2, normalization
    + L1 lasso regression (`glmnet alpha==1`), sparse variables
    + L2 ridge regression (`glmnet alpha==0`), smaller coeff, less sensitive to outliers
* Caret package allows mixing L1 & L2 regularization, want to know if different lambdas can be used in the mixture

*****
### Number of folds experiment

* Number of folds don't impact model results very much, especially on datasets with large number of rows
* Results may be unstable when a very small fold is used (<4)
