## Welcome to my learning on machine learning

This is a place for me to build hypothesis, do experiments, and record my learnings using various datasets. 



*****
### Guideline

* When making decisions, keep in mind trade-offs based on running speed, explainability, simplicity, performance, and more

*****
### Logistic regression

* L1, L2, normalization
    + L1 lasso regression (`glmnet alpha==1`), sparse variables
    + L2 ridge regression (`glmnet alpha==0`), smaller coeff, less sensitive to outliers

#### Number of folds experiment
